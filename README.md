# Health System Front-end
The initial idea is to create a backend where the user can schedule a consultation with a doctor. </br>
Maybe in the future add some features like videocall for online medical consultation. </br>
The frontend will be done in Nuxt/Vue, you can follow the <a href="https://github.com/Salah-ZEddine/Health-Connect"> frontend here </a> </br>
The main goal of this project is to practice Java and its architecture.

## Data model
<img width="450px" src="./HealthSystem.png" />

You have three possibilities of users: <strong>Patient</strong>, <strong>Doctor</strong>, and <strong>Company</strong>.</br>
For now, the password is not required because there's no login system yet. But the idea in the future is allow the possibility to have a dashboard for the doctors/company. <br/>
Every user will have an address associated. After the first register, when the user tries to make another appointment, the user address info will be pre-loaded from the backend info, using the e-mail (unique).
